## Confirm

This is a test. A confirmation prompt asks the user to take or confirm an action, such as responding to a system event such as asking the user to restart the device after swapping SIM cards, or to ask the user to grant or deny permission to perform a task.

> ### Characteristics
> * Opened from buttons within app content; these buttons are often inside toolbars (for example, the Browser app’s “Share” button).
> * Action menus contain one or more items.
> * Buttons have two states: normal and pressed.
> * These menus expand in height to accomodate their items, to a maximum of the screen’s height. Once that maximum height is reached.
